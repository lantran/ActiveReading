# Pre-reading questions
1. What will the text be about?
	How your thinking is what makes you feel a certain way
2. What questions am I looking to answer?
	How does your thinking affect the way you feel? What is the mental model?
3. What do I know about the topic already?
	Your thoughts precede your feelings. The proof of this is that two identical stimuli can make two different people different ways.

	Dr. Burns makes the assertion that when you feel depressed, that feeling is caused by some negative/automatic thought that preceded it. He asserts that these negative/automatic thoughts have gross distortions in them.
	He goes on to list those distortions. The chapter ends with a quiz to help the reader practice identifying those distortions in short blurbs.

# During reading notes
1.	a. Turn headers and sub-headers into questions
	b. After a meaningful chunk, take the time to summarize the major points

	1. Understanding Your Moods: You Feel the Way You Think -> How does our thinking affect the way we feel?
		* Depression is not an emotional disorder
		* Illogical pessimistic attitudes play a central role in the development and continuation of your symptoms
		* Every time you feel depressed, try to identify the negative automatic thought that preceded it. By learning to restructure those thoughts, you can change your mood.
		<Place image here about the relationship between thoughts and feelings>
		* You must understand what is happening to you before you can feel it!
		* When you are depressed, you possess the remarkable ability to believe, and to get the people around you to believe, things which have no basis in reality
	2. Defintions of Cognitive Distortions -> What are they distortions we experience when we are Depressed?
		1. All or Nothing Thinking
			* Forms the basis for perfectionism
			* It causes you to fear mistakes or imperfection because you will then see yourself as a complete loser, and you will feel inadequate and worthless
			* Absolutes do not exist in this universe
		2. Overgeneralization
			* Arbitrarily concluding that one thing that happened to you once will occur over and over again. Since what happened to you is unpleasant, you feel upset
			* The pain of rejection is almost entirely from overgeneralization
		3. Mental Filter
			* You pick out a negative detail in any situation and dwell on it exclusively, this perceiving that the whole situation is negative.
			* When you are depressed, you wear a pair of eyeglasses with special lenses that filter out anything positive. 
			* It is a bad habit which can cause you to suffer much needless anguish
		4. Disqualifying the positive
			* The persistent tendency of some depressed individuals to transform neural or even positive experiences into negative ones. You don't just ignore positive experiences, you cleverly and swiftly turn them into their nightmarish opposite. 
			* A real life example is how we respond to compliments. When someone praises your appearance or work, you might automatically tell yourself, "They're just being nice." You are mentally disqualifying their compliment
			* One of the most destructive forms of cognitive distortion
			* Causes an inability to appreciate good things that happen
		5. Jumping to Conclusions
			* Arbitrarily jump to a negative conclusion that is not justified by the facts of the situation.
				* Mind Reading - Suppose someone fails to respond to your email and you assume that they didn't because "they don't like you". You don't know unless you ask!
				* Fortune Teller Error - You imagine that something bad is about to happen, and you take this prediction as a fact even though it is unrealistic. Suppose you tell yourself, "I can't handle this." Of course you can, you're doing it right now.
		6. Magnification and Minimization
			* Maginification commonly occurs when you look at your own errors, fear, or imperfections and exaggerate their importance
			* Minimization commonly occurs when you look at your strengths and deem them small or unimportant
		7. Emotional Reasoning
			* You take your emotions as evidence for truth
			* "I feel bad, therefore I am bad."
			* This assumes your feelings cause your thoughts, when in reality it is the opposite
			* One usual side effect of emotional reaosning is procrastination. 
		8. Should Statements
			* You try to motivate yourself by saying, "I should do this" or "I must do that". These statements cause you to feel pressured and resentful.
			* These statements when used on others also cause yourself distress.
			* They generate a lot of unnecessary emotional turmoil
			* Humans are not perfect, and thus as such should not be expected to be perfect.
		9. Labeling and Mislabeling
			* Creating a completely self-image based on your errors. It is an extreme form of overgeneralization
			* Your self cannot be equated by any one thing you do.
			* When you label other people, you will invariably generate hostility.
			* Mislabeling involves describing an event with words that inaccurate and emotionally heavily loaded. 
				ex. A woman on a diet ate a dish of ice cream and thought, "How disgusting and repulsive of me. I'm a pig." These thoughts made her so upset she ate the whole quart of ice cream!
		10. Personalization
			* You assume responsbility for a negative event when there is no basis for doing so
				* ex. When a patient doesn't do their self-help assignment and the therapist conlcudes , "I must be a lousy therapist, It's my fault she isn't working harder to help yourself. It's my responsibility to make sure she gets well."
			* Causes you to feel crippling guilt
			* Confuses influence for control over others
			* What other people do is ultimately their responsibility, not yours.
	3. Feelings aren't facts-> Why are feelings not facts?
		* They are just a mirror for your thoughts
		* Your thoughts create your emotions; therefore, your emotions cannot prove that your thoughts are accurate. 
		* Your feelings are not special
		* When you experience life more realistically, you will experience an enhanced emotional life with a greater appreciate for genuine sadness-which lacks distortion- as well as joy.
