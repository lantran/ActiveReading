# During reading notes
### 1. Turn headers and sub-headers into questions. After a meaningful chunk, take the time to summarize the major points.
######	1. How does Dr. Burns use his techniques in his own life?
* Dr. Burns uses the double column technique on a sheet of paper on the train home to deal with nagging emotional hangovers

######	2. How did Dr. Burns deal with a man who had fired Twenty Doctors?
* Dr. Burns is treated a patient who had previously fired twenty doctors because they would not give him a physical diagnosis for his back pain. Dr. Burns saw him after he had already fired another psychiatrist. The patient was super angry, and would take it out him. The patient accused him of not caring about him, only caring about the money and his high success rate. Because there was a grain of truth to those accusations, Dr. Burns found himself feeling guilty, and the patient would pile on.
* Dr. Burns used this four step approach:
	1. Don't defend yourself, encourage them to say all the negative things
	2. Try to find a grain of truth in his criticisms and agree with him
	3. After this, point out any areas of disagreement in a straightforward, tactful, and nonargumentative manner. 
	4. Emphasize the importance of sticking together, in spite of these occasional disagreements.
* Dr. Burns also used the double column tchnique for dealing with automatic thoughts after the patient, Hank, would call him at midnight and start haranguing him.

####### 3. How did Dr. Burns deal with a woman that couldn't express gratitude?
* Dr. Burns had a patient who was hysterical about not being able to make the "right" choice about which college to attend. She called one day and told him she really needed some help, so he rearranged his schedule to consult with one of his colleagues. Dr. Burns then called her back and she was able to make a decision within 15 minutes. It doesn't say what technique he suggested to her. But afterward when he asked her if his techniques helped she claimed they were worthless and didn't thank him. Dr. Burns was initally miffed about the situation and became agitated. He used the double column technique to identify what was upsetting him. It was that when he makes an effort to help others, they SHOULD be grateful. That kind of thinking will upset you. It would be nice, but you can't expect it. Many times that is the case, but sometimes it won't. You can get satisfaction from yourself for a good effort, you need not wait for it from others.

###### 4. How did Dr. Burns deal with a patient who attempted suicide while under his care?
* Dr. Burns had a 20 year old patient who had attempted suicide many times. She was extremely hopeless. One day he came into his office and found she had slipped a morose 20 page letter about how depressed she was. He called her apartment to find that she had skipped town and left no clues about her whereabouts. She had done this before when she had attempted suicide. Dr. Burns felt anxious and angry, and used the double column technique to help his upsetness. He assumed she was dead somewhere. Through the double column exercise, he realizes that assuming she was dead was not helpful, he was not responsible for her suicide, his colleagues won't look down on him, and her parents may or may not be mad. He can only control his effort. He felt much better. It ended up that she was found unconscious in a motel 50 miles from Philadelphia. She was in pretty bad condition. It took another 11 months of treatment for her depression to break.

# Post reading
### 1. Come up with a few questions that you'd ask someone else to gauge how well they comprehended the text.
###### 1. What technique does Dr. Burns frequently use to deal with anxiety/depression/anger?
* He heavily uses the double column technique for capturing automatic/negative thoughts. He then uses the righthand column to answer back to those with rational responses.
* He deals with criticism/negativity bombarded at him in a novel way. He focuses on finding grains of truth in the splatter. This is crucial because it takes the wind out of the sails of the assaulter. He then reiterates his point nonargumentatively and repeats how crucial it is the relationship stay amicable.

###### 2. What situations were described in the chapter? What are some situations in your own life where you can apply some of these responses to difficult situations?
* He described a situation with an angry, abusive patient and how he dealt with it.
* He described a situation with a thankless patient and how expecting praise for a job well done is unnecessary. You get satisfaction from you know you did a good job.
* He described a situation where a patient under his care attempted suicide and how he used the double column technique to help his distorted mindset during that trying time.

* I personally am a huge fan of the double column (more like triple because I like to identify which distortion that automatic thought is associated with). I also find that the taking the winds of out other's sails by agreeing with criticism/abuse is highly effective. These are two tools that I keep handy in my mood toolbox.
