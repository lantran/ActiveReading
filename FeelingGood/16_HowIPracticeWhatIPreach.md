######	Coping With Hostility: The Man who Fired Twenty Doctors -> How did Dr. Burns
deal with a man who had fired Twenty Doctors?
	* Dr. Burns is treated a patient who had previously fired twenty doctors because they would not give him a physical diagnosis for his back pain. Dr. Burns saw him after he had already fired another psychiatrist. The patient was super angry, and would take it out him. The patient accused him of not caring about him, only caring about the money and his high success rate. Because there was a grain of truth to those accusations, Dr. Burns found himself feeling guilty, and the patient would pile on.
	* Dr. Burns used this four step approach:
		1. Don't defend yourself, encourage them to say all the negative things
		2. Try to find a grain of truth in his criticisms and agree with him
		3. After this, point out any areas of disagreement ina straightforward, tactful, and nonargumentative manner. 
		4. Emphasize the importance of sticking togethe, in spite of these occasional disagreements.
	Dr. Burns also used the double column tchnique for dealing with automatic thoughts after the patient, Hank, would call him at midnight and start haranguing him.
