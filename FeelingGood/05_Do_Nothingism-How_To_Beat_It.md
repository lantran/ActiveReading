###### How to beat Do-Nothingism -> How can I beat Do-Nothingism?
* One way we can help our moods is by modfiying the way we think
* Another way is to modify what we do
* The hitch is that when we're depressed it can be difficult to do anything
* Doing nothing can contribute to a vicious cycle where we feel worse about ourselves and do even less
* Some common explanations about why we procrastinate that are not accurate:
	1. You're basically lazy, it's your nature
		* Contains a distortion - labeling
	2. You want to hurt yourself or suffer
		* Nobody actually ENJOYS misery
		* If you aren't convinced, give yourself the paperclip test:
			* Straighten a paperclip and jam it under your nail. Do you really enjoy this?
	3. You're passive-aggressive, you want to frustrate the people around you by doing nothing
		* Many depressed people do not actually feel angry.
		* Resentment can contribute to lack of motivation
		* The implication that you are __intentionally__ doing nothing to frustrate others is insulting and untrue
	4. You must get some "payoff" from it. Like the attention you receive from others
		* There is a grain of truth here from a behavioral perspective
		* Howver, depressed individuals generally do not enjoy the attention because of their tendency to disqualify (distortion #4).
* A more convincing explanation is that behind the procrastination are thoughts which contain distortions
* [Insert graphic here](Self-defeating thoughts -> Self-defeating actions -> Consequences of the Lethargy Cycle -> Self-defeating emotions
		^-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|)
* Mindsets commonly associated with do-nothingism:
	1. Hopelessness
		* You find the idea that things will be better in the future impossible
		* This is a fortune telling (distortion #5a)
	2. Helplessness
		* The idea that your moods are not in your control - be it genetic, environment, fate, luck, etc.
	3. Overwhelming yourself
		* Magnification of the effort a task involves
			* It is equivalent to imagining all the food you have to eat this week and saying to yourself, "There's no point in eating a hamburger because it won't even make a dent."
		* This is a magnification (distortion #6)
	4. Jumping to Conclusions
		* You sense that it is not in your power to take effective action
		* This is (distortion #5b)
	5. Self-Labeling
		* Calling yourself lazy, feeling worse, and doing less. A vicious cycle
		* This is (distortion #9)
	6. Undervaluing the reward
		* Anhedonia - inability to experience satisfaction or pleasure
		* This is disqualifying the positive (distortion #4)
	7. Perfectionism
		* This is a side effect of all-or-nothing thinking (distortion #1)
	8. Fear of Failure
		* Because you imagine that putting in the effort and not suceeding would be a massive personal defeat, you don't try at all
		* This involves a couple of distortions (overgeneralization, fortune telling)
		* This also involves a product oriented mindset rather than a process oriented mindset
		* Process oriented mindsets are far more enjoyable that product focused ones
	9. Fear of Success
		* Due to a lack of confidence, success feels riskier than failure because you are certain that the success is due to luck, not skill
		* Therefore, you are convinced you cannot keep it up and will eventually be outed
		* In an effort to maintain control, you avoid commitment or involvement
	10. Fear of Disapproval or Criticism
		* You imagine that if you try something new, any mistake or flub will be met with strong disapproval and criticism beause the people you care about won't acccept you if you are human and imperfect
	11. Coercion and Resentment
		* This happens when you try to motivate yourself with "shoulds" and "musts"
		* This makes you feel like a delinquent child who is being disciplined
		* Why do this to yourself?
	12. Low Frustration Tolerance
		* You assume you should be able to solve your problems and reach your goals rapidly and easily, so you go into a frenzied panic and rage when life presents you with obstacles
		* You retailiate against the "unfairness" by giving up completely
		* Your frustration results from a dissonance between reality and ideality
			* It doesn't occur to you that is might be infinitely easier to change your expectations than to twist reality
		* This frustration generally stems from "should" statements
			* "For all the miles I've gone, I should be in better shape by now"
	13. Guilt and Self-blame
		* If you are frozen in the conviction that you are bad or have let others down, you will naturally feel unmotivated to pursue your daily life
		* This is an personlization error(distortion #10) 
		* You are human, not God, and you cannot predict the future or know precisely how to intervene in all scenarios
		* Humans make mistakes by definition
###### What are some practical things I can do to combat "Do-Nothingism"?
