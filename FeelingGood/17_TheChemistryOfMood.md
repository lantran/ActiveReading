# Pre-reading questions
1. What will the text be about?
How chemicals in the brain can affect our moods.
2. What questions am I looking to answer?
What chemicals and reactions in the brain/body can potentially have an effect on our moods.
3. What do I know about the topic already?
Two chemicals I know of are seratonin and dopamine. They fire frmo neuron to neuron over the synaptical cleft, but am unsure how they are processed by the body. They may be created by various activities or drugs, and are important for feelings of overall well-being
Skim the text to get an idea for the structure of the text
Seems to go over what is bipolar, what is depression, what do we know about the brain and emotions, the chemical situation up there, what different drugs there are to treat it, and how they work.


# During reading notes
1. Turn headers and sub-headers into questions
	a. The Search for "Black Bile" -> What is "Black Bile" and why are we searching for it?
		What if science came up for a happy pill? What are the ethical dilemmas of it? Some people believe prozac is that pill, but it isn't. Some people do not respond well to it, some do, but incompletely. We do not know how the brain and emotions are connected fully. Why are some people prone to negative thinking while others are eternal optimists? Is it genetic? Is it learned? We'll cover the these questions as well as the current solutions for the body in this chapter.
	b. Do Genetics or Environment Play a Greater Role in Depression? -> (same)
		Bipolar is highly correlated with genetics. If one identical twin has it, theres a 50-75% chance the other one will develop it. If there are nonidentical twins, that is closer to 15-25%. If someone in the family has it, that number goes down to 10%. If someone in the family doesn't have it, it's closer to 1%. For garden variety depression, it isn't so clear. Where does sadness end and clinical depression begin?
	c. Is Depression Caused by a "Chemical Imbalance" in the brain? -> (same)
		Not entirely sure. Even with ever increasingly sophisticated tools, we cannot conclude this. However, many things we might think are learned may be genetic, such as outgoingness or proclivity to flavors of ice cream.
	d. How Does the Brain Work? -> (same)
		The brain has different parts which are responsible for different functions. For example, the limbic system is responsible for your emotions. The occiptal cortex is at the back and responsible for your eyesight. There's a part on the left side responsible for speaking. If it were damaged, you'd wouldn't have problems coming up with words but you would have problems speaking. 
		The brain is controlled by a network of electrical impulses. These travel down the nerves, or wires of the brain. They hop from synapse to synapse, using neurotransmitters to bridge the synaptic fluid between synapses. When there is unabsorbed seratonin (a neurotransmitter) the body uses an enzyme called MAO to metabolise it into something that can be excreted via urine.
	e. What goes wrong in Depression?
		While there is no definitive answer, some scientists theorize depression could be linked to too little or too much seratonin/norepeneferine/dopamine. It is pretty difficult to prove definitively given today's technology. 
	f. How do antidepressant drugs work?
		They basically either inhibit the destruction of certain neurotransmitters or mimic the shape of them so they can unlock the receptors on the synapses.



2. After a meaningful chunk, take the time to summarize the major points

# Post reading
1. Come up with a few questions that you'd ask someone else to gauge how well they comprehended the text.
	- What three neurotransmitters are believed to have an effect on mood?

	- What part of depression can be attributed to genetics?

	- How do electrical impulses travel through the brain?
