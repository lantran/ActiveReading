### Turn headers and sub-headers into questions. After a meaningful chunk, take the time to summarize the major points.
###### Ways of Defeating Guilt -> What can I do to combat feelings of guilt?
* Guilt is the idea that because you did something you should or should've have done that you are a "bad person"
* There are key differences between guilt and remorse/regret
	* Guilt's source is distorted thoughts while remorse/regret are from undistorted thoughts
	* Guilt's endgame is justifying that you are a "bad" person while remorse/regret is learning how not to "goof-up" again
	* There are three common assumptions associated with guilt:
		1. Because of my "bad behavior", I am inferior or worthless -> Leads to depression
		2. If others found out what I did, they would look down on me -> Leads to shame
		3. I'm in danger of retaliation or punishment -> Leads to anxiety
	* The simplest way to determine if these thoughts are useful or destructive is to take an investigative approach to determine if these thoughts contain any cognitive distortions
	* Some common distortions include:
		1. An assumption that you have done something wrong? Could you be perhaps *magnifying* things out of proportion?
		2. You are *labeling* yourself a bad person
		3. You inappropriately assume responsibility for an event you did not cause *personalization*
		4. Inappropriate "should" statements
			* Should statements based on the premise you are all-powerful assume, lie God, you are omnipotent and have the ability to control yourself and other people so as to acheieve each and every goal
	* Aside from the distortions, several other criteria can be helpful in distinguishing abnormal guilt from a healthy sense of remorse of regret:
		* Intensity
		* Duration
		* Consequences of your negative emotion
		* Example: TODO insert example here
###### The Guilt Cycle -> What is the Guilt Cycle?
	* The Guilt cycle is once you feel guilty, you may become trapped in an illusion that makes the guilt appear valid
        * You reason
          1. I feel guilty and worthy of condemnation. This means I've been bad
          2. Since I'm bad, I deserve to suffer
        * Your initial guilt convinces you of your badness and ultimately leads to more guilt
        * This is a textbook case of emotional reasoning (distortion #?)
        * Your self-loathing doesn't necessarily prove you've done anything wrong
        * Your guilt only reflects the fact that you __believe__ you have behaved badly
        * This might be the case, but often it is not 
          * Example: children are frequently punished inappropriately when parents are feeling tired and irritable and misinterpret their child's behavior
        * Many people believe that guilt is to their advantage because it'll be the fire that lights their motivation, but the opposite is true
        * Feeling guilty is extremely emotionally draining
        * Feeling guilty can reinforce the inappropriate labels that one feels about themselves
###### The Irresponsibility of Guilt -> What makes feeling guilty an irresponsible emotion?
        * Ponder this: 
          * I 100% did something inappropriate or hurtful            
          * Does it follow that you deserve to suffer?
          * If yes, for how long? One day? One year? What sentence are you willing to impose on yourself?
          * Are you willing to stop the suffering after you've finished your sentence?
          * This would at least be a responsible way of approaching it
          * Many times, we don't even think about this
        * What advantage do we gain from abusing ourselves with guilt?
          * It won't reverse the mistake in any meaningful way
          * It won't speed up the learning process so you reduce the chance of repeating the mistake
          * Other people don't love or respect us more because you are feeling guilty and putting yourself down
        * Many people ask, "But how could I behave morally and control my impulses if I don't feel guilt?
        * The above question is a probation officer approach to life
        * Do you view yourself as so willfull and uncontrollable that you must constantly berate yourself in order to keep from going wild?
        * It never helped anyone to view themselves as a __bad__ person
        * Change and learning most readily occur when:
          1. We recognize that an error has occured
          2. We develop a strategy for correcting the problem. An attitude of self-love and relaxation facilitates this, whereas guilt often interferes
        * Try replacing your guilt with empathy
        * Empathy gives you the necessary mental and emotional climate to guide guide your behavior in a moral and self-enhancing manner
###### How can I determine if I am feeling healthy remorse or distorted guilt?
        1. Did I consciously and willfully do something "bad", "unfair", or needlessly hurtful that I shouldn't have? Or am I irrationally expecting myself to perfect, all-knowing, or all-powerful?
        2. Am I labeling myself a __bad__ or __tainted__ person because of this action? Do my thoughts contain distortions such as magnification, overgeneralization, etc.?
        3. Am I feeling realistic regret or remorse, which results from an empathetic awareness of the negative impact of my action?
        4. Am I learning from my error and developing a strategy for change, or am I moping and ruminating nonproductively or even destructively
###### What are some practical things I can do to deal with my feelings of guilt?
        1. Daily Record of Dysfunctional Thought
        2. Should Removal Techniques
        3. Wrist Counter Method
        4. Obsessional-filibuster technique from Chapter 4
        5. 
        6. Ask yourself "Why should I?" to expose cognitive distortions in your thinking
###### Learn to stick to your guns -> How can removing guilt stop others from manipulating me?
        * If you feel obligated to please everyone, family and friends can easily coerce you into doing things that are not in your best self interest
        * For example, how many social invitations have you halfheartedly accepted so as to not hurt someone's feelings?
        * How can we practically stick to our guns?
          1. Remind the other party it is our right not to say yes to all demands made of us
          2. Find a grain of truth (to disarm) the other party
          3. Adopt a strong, decisive and uncompromising position as tactfully as possible
          4. Don't buy into anyone's role of weakness or inadequacy
          5. Do not respond to anger by getting angry yourself
          6. You have to be okay with hte risk that the other party will temporarily withdraw
        * Remember, the hurt you inflict in the long term by not following your best self-interest is far greater than the temporary hurt of not giving into other's demands
###### The Antiwhiner Technique -> What is the Antiwhiner Technique?                                        
        * A technique you can use given this situation:
          * A loved one makes you feel frustrated, guilty, and helpless through whining, complaining, and nagging
        * The typical cycle looks like:
          1. The whiner complains to you about something or someone
          2. You feel the sincere desire to be helpful, so you make a suggestion
          3. The person immediately squashes your suggestion and complains again
          4. You feel tense and inadequate, so you try harder and make another suggestion
          5. You get the same response
          6. Anytime you try to break loose from the conversation, the other person implies he or she is being abandoned, and you are flooded with guilt
        * The steps to breaking the cycle
          1. Agree with the whiner(disarming them)
          2. Instead of offering advice, say something genuinely complimentary
        * Why does this work?
          * The whiner is generally feeling overwhelmed, irritated, or insecure
          * When you offer a suggestion, it appears to them as criticism because it implies they aren't handling the situation adequately
          * When you agree with them and add a compliment, they feel endorsed, then relaxed, then quiet down
###### The Moorey Moaner Method -> What is the Moorey Moaner Method?
        * A modification of the Antiwhiner Technique
        * Agree with what the person is saying (even if only in principle)
        * Distract the moaner by finding something positive in the complaint and commenting on it
###### Developing Perspective -> How can I develop perspective?
        * One distortion that is pervasively associated with guilt is personalization
        * An obvious example would be your sense of guilt when it rained unexpectedly on the day of a picnic you have organized to honor the retiring president of your club
        * Guilt can be more difficult when someone suffers substantial pain and discomfort and insists is result from their personal interaction with you
        * It can helpful to clarify the extent to which you can realistically assume responsibility
        * Where does your responsibility end and theirs begin?
        * The technical term here is "disattribution"
        * Can use the triple column technique (or double) to deal with your troubling automatic thoughts and find the distortions in them
