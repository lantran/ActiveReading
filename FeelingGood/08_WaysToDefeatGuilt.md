###### Ways of Defeating Guilt -> What can I do to combat feelings of guilt?
* Guilt is the idea that because you did something you should or should've have done that you are a "bad person"
* There are key differences between guilt and remorse/regret
	* Guilt's source is distorted thoughts while remorse/regret are from undistorted thoughts
	* Guilt's endgame is justifying that you are a "bad" person while remorse/regret is learning how not to "goof-up" again
	* There are three common assumptions associated with guilt:
		1. Because of my "bad behavior", I am inferior or worthless -> Leads to depression
		2. If others found out what I did, they would look down on me -> Leads to shame
		3. I'm in danger of retaliation or punishment -> Leads to anxiety
	* The simplest way to determine if these thoughts are useful or destructive is to take an investigative approach to determine if these thoughts contain any cognitive distortions
	* Some common distortions include:
		1. An assumption that you have done something wrong? Could you be perhaps *magnifying* things out of proportion?
		2. You are *labeling* yourself a bad person
		3. You inappropriately assume responsibility for an event you did not cause *personalization*
		4. Inappropriate "should" statements
			* Should statements based on the premise you are all-powerful assume, lie God, you are omnipotent and have the ability to control yourself and other people so as to acheieve each and every goal
	* Aside from the distortions, several other criteria can be helpful in distinguishing abnormal guilt from a healthy sense of remorse of regret:
		* Intensity
		* Duration
		* Consequences of your negative emotion
		* Example: TODO insert example here
