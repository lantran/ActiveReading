###### Sadness is Not Depression -> Why is Sadness not Depression?
* One topic that comes up frequently in Dr. Burns work is what happens if something actually bad happens?
* Some common examples are:
  1. Bankruptcy or financial hardship
  2. Old age (some people view infancy, childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, and mid-life as periods of inevitable crisis
  3. Permanent physical disability
  4. Terminal Illness
  5. Tragic loss of a loved one
* What is the distinction between "healthy sadness" and depression?
  * Sadness is a normal emotion created by realistic perceptions that describe a negative event involving loss or disappointment in an undistorted way
  * Depression is an illess that __always__ results from thoughts that are distorted in some way
  * Example: __Loss of a loved one__
    * __Sadness__ says, "I lost them and I will miss the companionship and loved we shared"
    * __Depression__ says, "I'll never be happy again because they died. It's unfair!"
  * Sadness creates tender, realistic, and desirable feelings based on undistorted thoughts
  * Depression creates self-pity and hopeless feelings based on distorted thoughts  
  * Sadness does not involve a loss of self-esteem or worth
  * Depression appearing after an obvious stress, like ill health, death of a loved one, or business reversal is sometimes referred to as a "reactive depression"
  * If the emotion does not have a positive function, is it really to your advantage to induldge it?
###### Loss of Life -> How do I cope with loss of life?
