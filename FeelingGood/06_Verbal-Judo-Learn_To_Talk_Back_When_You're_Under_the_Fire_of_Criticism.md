### Turn headers and sub-headers into questions. After a meaningful chunk, take the time to summarize the major points.
###### 1. Verbal Judo: Learn to Talk Back When You're Under the Fire of Criticism -> How can I effectively deal with criticism?
* Our sense of worthlessness is caused by your internal criticisms of yourself
* Many times depressive episodes are sparked by external criticism
* Why is it that some people handle criticism well, while others crumble in the face of it?
* No matter how harsh, vicious, or heartless someone's criticism is, they have __ZERO__ power to disturb you or create even a _little bit__ of discomfort
* Only one person in the world has the power to _put you down_-and *YOU* are that person
* When someone criticizes you, certain negative thoughts are automatically triggered in your head
* Your emotional reaction will be created by these thoughts and not by what the other person says.
* These thoughts which upset you will invariably contain the type mental errors as detailed in Chapter 3.
* Try the double or triple column technique for capturing these automatic thoughts

| Automatic Thought | Mental Error (optional in double) | Rational Response|
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|
|					|								    |                  |

* Once you can deal with those automatic thoughts, you will have more mental energy for turning the criticism into action items to improve your process
* If people criticize you, they can either be right or wrong
	* If they are wrong, there is nothing for you to be upset about
		* Why should you be disturbed if someone else makes the mistake of criticizing you in an injust manner? That;s the other guy's error, not yours. Why upset yourself? Do you expect that other people would be perfect?
	* If they are right, there is still no need to be overwhelmed
		* You're not expected to be perfect
		* Acknowledge your error and take whatever steps you can to correct it

###### 2. How can I handle these difficult situations?
1. Empathy
	* Ask the person a series of specific questions designed to find out eactly what he or she means
		* Avoid being judgement or defensive as you ask the questions
		* Constantly ask for more and more specific information
		* Attempt to see the world through their eyes
		* If the person attacks you with vague, insulting labels, ask them to be more specific and point out exactly what is about you the person dislikes
		```
			Insert role play here because it is very illustrative
		```
		* By asking specific questions, you minimize the possibility that the critic will reject you completely
		* Both parties become more aware of the specific concrete problems at hand
		* Furthermore, you are actively listening to the critic, which gives you a chance to see things the way the critic does
		* This tends to difuse anger and hostility and introduces a problem-solving oritenting in the place of blame casting or debate
		* Even if you feel that the criticism is _totally_ injust, respond with empathy by asking questions
2. Disarming the critic
	* Whether your critic is right or wrong, intially find osme way to agree with them
	* Let's pretend they are right
		* You can respond with, "You're absolutely right", and reiterate their point
	* Let's pretend they are wrong and unfair and invalid
		* You can 
			1. Agree __in principle__ with the criticism
			2. Find some __grain__ of truth in the statement and agree with that
			3. Acknowledge that the persons upset is understandable because it is based on how they view the situation
		```
			Insert role play here because it is illustrative
		```
	* Because you refuse to fight back, the critic will usually lose steam
	* Without the steam, the critic will be in a better mood to communicate
	``` 
		Insert role play because it is illustrative
	```
	* You will notice you have a profound urge to __defend__ yourself when you are unjustly accused. This is a MAJOR mistake
		* This will increase the critic's intensity
		* This will escalate the situation
3. Feedback and Negotiation
	* If the critic is wrong, simply repeat your assertive response politely but firmly over and over until the person tires out
		* This is only feasible if you have done steps 1 and 2 to diffuse the critic's steam
	* Sometimes the solution is a compromise, which is more likely if you've done steps 1 and 2 already.
	* Sometimes you are just plain wrong
		* Assertively agree with the criticism
		* Thank the critic for providing you with the information
		* Apologize for any hurt you may have caused

	* If your message when receiving unfair criticsm is "I'm angry because you're criticising me and you're no damn good", you will *poison* your relationship with that person.
	* While this might feel good temporarily, it is harmful in the long run
		* You're essentially burning bridges here

###### 3. How can I handle hecklers?
* This is specific to those who lecture or teach
* The heckler usually have the following characteristics
	1. Intensely critical, but seem inaccurate or irrelevant to the material presented
	2. Often comes a person who is not well accepted or regarded among their peers
	3. Expressed in a haranguing, abusive style
* How can I deal with these hecklers?
	1. Immediately thank the heckler for their comment
	2. Acknowledge the points they made are __indeed__ important
	3. Emphasize there is a __need for more knowledge__ about the points raised, and I encourage the critic to pursue meaningful rsearch and investigation on the topic. 
	4. Invite the heckler to share their views one-on-one with me after the session

###### 4. What are the possibile outcomes of criticism
[Criticism Possibility Tree](https://www.janahans.com/criticism_possibility_tree)
* When you get are criticised, you can take one of three routes
	1. Sad
		* A tendency to feel depressed as you conclude the critic is automatically right
		* Without systematic investigation, you jump to the conclusion you were in the wrong
		* You then magnify the importance of the criticism with a series of thinking errors
		* You might overgeneralize and wrongly conclude your whole life is a series of errors
		* You might label yourself as a "total goof-up"
		* Your perfectionist expectation of yourself to feel that you are "worthless", which will lead to depression and a loss of self-esteem
	2. Mad
		* You stubbornly refuse to admit there is a possibilty you are imperfect because that would mean you are worthless
		* You hurl insults at the critic, which feels good temporarily
		* You're well on your way to poisoning the relationship
	3. Glad
		* This requires that you have self-esteem or at least act like you do
		* It is based on the premise that you are a worthwhile human and have no need to be perfect
		* When you are criticized, your initial response is __investigative__
			* Does the criticism contain a grain of truth?
			* What did I do that was objectionable?
			* Did I actually goof up?
* Whether or not your behavior was right or wrong, you will know that you are __right__ as a human, because you have finally perceived that your self-esteem was never at issue in the first place
